# Text-Classification-BERT

Reference: https://skimai.com/fine-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/

In this project, I build a text classifier that uses pre trained BERT for text classification

The BERT model has to be fined tuned on the dataset to let it acquire domain knowledge, that is why we use the Pre trained BERT and then fine tune it on the corpus that we have.
